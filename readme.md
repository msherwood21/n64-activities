# N64 Activities

A repository for the activities I create for my kid(s). This will be included
as a submodule in meta repositories as needed.

## TODO

- Add selector movement system
  - Need to keep track of box colors
  - Need to keep track of selector location (tie to box location?)
- Add libdragon sprite for acknowledgement
