# N64 Activities

A repository for the activities I create for my kid(s). This will be included
as a submodule in meta repositories as needed.

## Dependencies

An installation of the libdragon preview branch (although trunk may be fine
depending on when you pull this down). The ares emulator is recommended for
testing.

## Building

- `make emulate` for creating a ROM to be run by an emulator
- `make debug` for a ROM to be debugged on a cart
- `make release` for a final ROM
